# BookSwap
BookSwap is a Django-based web application designed to facilitate the exchange of second-hand books among users in a community. It allows users to create and personalize their profiles, upload books for listing, and explore books added by others. With features like preferred genre tagging, city-based user identification, and one-on-one messaging, BookSwap makes it easy for users to find relevant books and connect with their owners. The platform emphasizes user-friendliness through a clean interface, responsive design, and secure authentication, making it an ideal tool for students, readers, and collectors looking to share knowledge and save costs.
